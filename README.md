# **_Baked Goods Management System_** üç∞üçû

## _Project Description_

The Baked Goods Management System is a Kotlin-based application designed to streamline the management of baked goods and ingredients. This project employs a Gradle build system and provides a comprehensive set of features for adding, updating, deleting, searching, and listing baked goods. The system also supports data persistence through serialization, allowing users to save and load their baked goods.

## _Project Purpose_

The main purpose of this project is to offer an efficient solution for organizing and managing baked goods. The application enables users to:

- **Add new baked goods** with details such as name, description, price, category, and refrigeration status.
- **Update existing baked goods** to reflect changes in information.
- **Delete baked goods** that are no longer needed.
- **Search for baked goods** by various criteria, including ingredient names and allergens.
- **List baked goods** based on different parameters, such as refrigeration status, price range, and category.
- **Mark Ingredient Allergens** marks allergens for an ingredient in an existing baked good.
- **Save baked goods** to a JSON file for persistent storage.
- **Load previously saved baked goods** from a JSON file.

With these functionalities, the Baked Goods Management System aims to be a valuable tool for businesses and individuals involved in baking and selling baked goods.

## _Getting Help_

During the development of this project, I utilized the following resources:

- **kolor GitHub Repository**: I used the [kolor](https://github.com/ziggy42/kolor) library to add color to the console text, enhancing the user interface.
- **Emojis**:  I referred to the Unicode emoji table [here](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9740565/display-emoji-emotion-icon-in-android-textview).
